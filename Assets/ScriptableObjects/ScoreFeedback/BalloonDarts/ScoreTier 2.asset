  - Nice effort! You're starting to get the hang of this. Let's aim for more pops
    next time!
  - You're on the right track! With a bit more practice, you'll be popping balloons
    left and right.
  - Good job! You've popped a couple. Keep going and you'll hit even more!
  - A solid start! Fine-tune your aim and you'll see even more balloons burst.
  - A few balloons down! Keep practicing, and you'll be a balloon-popping star in
    no time.
